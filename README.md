Principia Skidoo or; “How I learned to stop worrying and see the fnords.”

First order:
Skidoo is not immune to the Law of Fives, nor the Seventeen, nor the Twentythree enigmata.

Second order: 
Offering of Skidoo to Eris may bring illumination, offer with caution—or don’t. It may also cause flushness, shortness of breath, cold fingers, pins and needles in the feet and hands, and gas.

Third order: 
Of each Skidoo (and there are twenty-three), one one thousandth is a single Chao. Proper offering shall result in bestowation of milliChao which are tiny, very tiny indeed. Improper offering results in nil.

Fourth order: 
There is no Goddess but Goddess, and she is your Goddess.

Fifth order:
How wilt thou value Skidoo? Five tons of flax.
